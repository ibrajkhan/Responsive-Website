     <p>It is another very common preprocessing technique that is used in machine learning. Basically it is used to eliminate the mean from feature vector so that every feature is centered on zero. We can also remove the bias from the features in the feature vector</p>
     <p>Naïve Bayes is a classification technique used to build classifier using the Bayes theorem. The assumption is that the predictors are independent. In simple words, it assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For building Naïve Bayes classifier we need to use the python library called scikit learn. There are three types of Naïve Bayes models named Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernoulli under scikit learn package. </p>
